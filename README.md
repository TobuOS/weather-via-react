This project is simply a demonstration of my ability to use React to build a UI.

Things to note:

-Axios was used in place of fetch, but I'm more than capable of using fetch if a project required so

-Moment.js isn't ideal for a scalable application, and would be swapped for something a bit more modern in a bigger real-world application

-Bootstrap was used for some styling. I didn't spend much time at all on truly styling as I figured the main goal of this project was to demonstrate my React skill. Although honestly I do genuinely love doing all my own styling (CSS and SCSS are my first loves)

-I did go a bit div crazy, I do usually use far better syntax
